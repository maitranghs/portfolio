# Welcome to BUI THI MAI TRANG page
## (Bridge) Software Engineer

[About me] I am a highly experienced software engineer with more than 8 years specialized in Web Application Development (using Java, JavaScript and PHP and various frameworks). I am familiar and efficient in different stages of software development, i.e. de- sign, develop, test and write manual (even in Japanese). I can work independently or collaboratively and am highly adaptable to new projects and new working environments. My mother tongue is Viet- namese and I can communicate fluently (both oral and written) in Japanese (I spent more than 3 years working in Japan) and English.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/maitranghs/portfolio/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/maitranghs/portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
