**_Online Shop for NormosReddot (The Hour Glass)_**  
_7th September 2018 - 7th October 2018_  
**Website:** [https://nomosreddot.thehourglass.com/](https://nomosreddot.thehourglass.com/)

**Description:** The Online Shop of NormosReddot is an e-commercial website that introduces and processes orders for 2 lines of limited-edition watches for only the Singaporean market from Reddot.
The project spanned only 1 month. When I joined the project was reaching the final deadline in 1 month with many functions buggy or un-implemented. But in the last month when I joined we work hard continuously and make it on time for release. 
I contributed mostly to two pages: product-detail-page and single-checkout-page.
The project required me to use Vue Storefront PWA (progressive web apps), the solution for online shopping website. 
I was in charge of fixing some layouts/ functionality bugs as well as adding new features, both on the front-end and backend (with nodeJS API).
Especially, I programmed the functionality of the single-checkout-page, the most important page of the Online Shop where I had to adapt the default procedure of Vue Storefront (a step-by-step checkout page) into a single page. The single-checkout-page also comprises the Stripe payment function which I was the main contributor.

**Technologies used:** NodeJS, Express, REST API, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Vue, VueX, Vue-router, Promise, Stripe, Intercom; Docker, Debugger for Chrome, Visual Studio Code
